This is my write up about the project. I learned a lot of things in this project.
I learned how to use properly matplot lib functions in python. Along with that I was able to also do a nice EDA about my dataset. I was not confident initially about my Python knowledge but after doing this project I got a first hand experience on how to do a proper data analyzing using python. This is one of the best project I worked on as it has given me immense knowldege and confidence.

I used a filter function which was able to categorize Gender/Countries etc. I have used in several places the same functiion. Inititally I had issues with categorizing the data. But with the help of this function I was able to easily do it.

Some insight I saw was that Canada is doing well compared to other countries with respect to attitude towards mental health sickness. This was clearly seen in my comparison.

Lastly Thank you professor for giving this wonderfull Assignment to work on which really enhanced our skill. And also I want to tell that I learned a lot about git after doing this project.
